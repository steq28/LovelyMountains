      'Hi, we are Ste and Mic we\'re two friends that who didnt had nothing to do during august and we decided to create an app to go hiking\
                Ste didn\'t care much, but Mic thought it was useful, and here we are.\n\
                PS: We spent too much time on the design of this app.. hence, if you dont like it, dont tell us.\n\
                PPS: We really like "Brasato" (a sort of stew very popular in north italy), so, if you want to make a present for us dont hesisate to contact us, ðŸ¥˜ <3',
